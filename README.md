# P2P Media Streaming System

This repository contains the development of a **Bachelor's Thesis** project that focuses on creating a system for **Video on Demand (VOD)** and **Live streaming** using the [**P2PMedia Loader**](https://github.com/Novage/p2p-media-loader) library. The system leverages **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** technology to reduce bandwidth usage, optimize data traffic, and enhance the overall streaming experience for users. This project is part of the author's academic thesis for the degree in **Software Engineering**.

### Key Features:
- **P2P Media Loader Integration**: Efficiently integrates P2P technology to offload server bandwidth by sharing data between peers.
- **VOD Streaming**: Supports high-quality on-demand video streaming with optimized data delivery.
- **Live Streaming**: Provides real-time live streaming with low latency and reduced server load.
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Reduces streaming costs and infrastructure needs by distributing video data across peer networks.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily scalable to support high numbers of concurrent users without impacting performance.
